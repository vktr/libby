# A highly opinionated media library manager

Libby is a media library manager. It provides a high level overview and
insights of media files and their metadata. Given one or more paths, it scans
these paths recursively for any known media container files (`mkv`, `mp4`),
calculates movie hashes, runs ffprobe, etc.
